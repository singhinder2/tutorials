# [core]
# Reduce storage requirements by only storing most recent N MiB of block. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -coinstatsindex. WARNING: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, greater than 550 = automatically prune blocks to stay under target size in MiB).
# If you leave as 550, you'll see a log message like the following: Prune configured to target 550 MiB on disk for block and undo files.
prune=550

# [network]
# Add a node IP address to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open. This option can be set multiple times.

# Connect only to the specified node(s); can be set multiple times. Set to 0 to disable automatic connections.

# Accept incoming connections from peers.

# Allow fixed seeds if DNS seeds don't provide peers.

# If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network. Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Listening for incoming I2P connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to a local address and port.

# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.

# Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> arguments. You can generate this value at https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-rpc-auth-generator/. This option can be specified multiple times.

# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times. (default: 127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost)
