# [core]
# Reduce storage requirements by only storing most recent N MiB of block. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -coinstatsindex. WARNING: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, greater than 550 = automatically prune blocks to stay under target size in MiB).
# If you leave as 550, you'll see a log message like the following: Prune configured to target 550 MiB on disk for block and undo files.
prune=550

# [debug]
# Log IP Addresses in debug output.
logips=1
# Send trace/debug info to console instead of debug.log.
printtoconsole=1

# [rpc]
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
server=1
# Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> arguments. You can generate this value at https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-rpc-auth-generator/. This option can be specified multiple times.

# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times. (default: 127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost)

# Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified source. Valid for <ip> are a single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g. 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24). This option can be specified multiple times.
